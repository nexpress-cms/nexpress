# Theme Contract v0.2 — Extension Plan

> Version: 0.2 (Frozen — shipped)
> Date: 2026-05-08 (design lock) / 2026-05-09 (phase complete)
> Status: **Shipped.** Phases F.1 → F.9 merged to main; live
> in `@nexpress/core`, `@nexpress/blocks`, `@nexpress/theme`,
> `@nexpress/next`, `@nexpress/admin`, `@nexpress/cli`,
> `@nexpress/web`, the three v0.2 reference themes
> (`theme-magazine`, `theme-docs`, `theme-portfolio`), and the
> shipped `theme-default` baseline.
> Prerequisites: AGENTS.md theme section + `docs/theme-authoring.md`
> (v0.1 contract), issue #541 (theme rethink discussion)
> Frozen-snapshot note: most code samples in this document remained
> accurate through implementation. Where shipped behavior
> diverged from the design intent (e.g. F.7's `error.tsx`
> delegation blocked by Next's client-component constraint;
> F.9.1 follow-ups for picker UI / textarea / etc.), the
> relevant section's deferred-to-v0.3 list captures it.
> Cookbook (`docs/theme-authoring.md`) is the live reference
> — read that for the as-shipped API.
> Post-ship update: the install command shipped as
> `pnpm exec nexpress theme add <pkg>` rather than the original design-phase
> command name, and
> `theme-default` remains a built-in baseline instead of being absorbed into
> `theme-magazine`. Theme removal later settled on the friendlier
> `pnpm exec nexpress theme remove <pkg>` spelling.

## 0. Position statement

The realistic ceiling of this work is **content-centric sites**.
Twitter clones, Spotify clones, Figma clones — those are apps,
not CMS sites, and no theme contract reaches them. The ambition
is "everything WordPress themes cover, plus a bit more, without
WordPress's runtime mutation chaos."

Two requirements drive every decision below:

- **Theme developer**: any content-centric site shape buildable
  in React, with no waiting on framework-level layout primitives.
- **Site operator**: from `pnpm install` through "site live and
  customized", **the operator never opens a code editor**. CLI
  use is limited to two commands: `pnpm exec nexpress theme add <pkg>`
  (config registration) followed by `pnpm db:migrate` (schema apply).
  Everything else happens in admin. Auto-chaining migrate is available
  through `theme add --apply`; the plain flow keeps the DB-write
  boundary explicit so the operator can review the generated migration
  before it touches the DB.

These pull in opposite directions — operator-no-code requires
themes to expose machine-readable contracts, theme-developer-
freedom requires those contracts to not constrain implementation.
The contract additions below are designed to honor both.

## 1. Locked decisions

Resolved before this doc was written; restated for the record.

| #   | Decision                                                    | Choice                                                                             | Rationale                                                                                                      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A   | Include `pnpm exec nexpress theme add` (CLI config registration) | **Yes**                                                                            | Without it, "operator no coding" promise breaks at theme activation.                                           |
| B   | Member/community surface skinning                           | **Out of scope**                                                                   | `(site)/members/*` carries strong behavior; needs its own track. Theme contract stays presentational for v0.2. |
| C   | Reference theme count after rebuild                         | **3 v0.2 references** (`magazine`, `docs`, `portfolio`) + `theme-default` baseline | Each presses a different axis. `theme-default` stays as the scaffold fallback; `theme-minimal` retired.        |
| D   | First implementation order                                  | **F.1 → F.2 → F.3 → ...**                                                          | F.2 (routes) is the largest unlock; F.1 (`requires`) is design-only and unblocks F.8.                          |

## 2. Goals

- Theme developer can express any content-centric site shape using
  arbitrary React + Next.js composition inside the contract.
- Site operator never opens a code editor. CLI use is limited
  to `pnpm exec nexpress theme add <pkg>` followed by `pnpm db:migrate`,
  or `theme add --apply` when the operator wants the CLI to chain
  schema generation and migration.
- Existing `defineTheme()` callers stay green. All v0.2 fields are
  additive options on `NpThemeImpl` / `NpThemeManifest`.
- Plugin and theme contributions (blocks, patterns, routes) merge
  cleanly through namespacing and clear precedence rules.

## 3. Non-goals

- Runtime collection / schema mutation (themes still can't change
  data shape at runtime — they declare requirements, CLI applies
  them at install time).
- WordPress-style global filter hooks letting themes mutate
  arbitrary framework behavior.
- Member/community surface skinning (deferred to a separate track).
- Page builder becoming a code editor (operator-no-code requires
  the surface to stay declarative).
- Theme-shipped server actions, API routes, or DB schema changes
  (those remain plugin territory).

## 4. Contract additions

Eight phases, each adding optional fields. Existing themes work
unchanged.

### 4.1 Phase F.1 — `manifest.requires`: data shape declaration

**Purpose**: themes declare the collection fields they assume.
F.8's CLI reads this to patch the operator's `src/collections/`.
Admin reads it to warn on activation when fields are missing.

**Shape**:

```ts
manifest: {
  requires?: {
    collections?: Record<string, NpThemeCollectionRequirement>;
  };
}

interface NpThemeCollectionRequirement {
  /** "exists" → just verify presence; "fields" → require these. */
  fields?: Record<string, NpThemeFieldRequirement>;
  /** True → CLI creates this collection if absent. */
  createIfAbsent?: boolean;
}

interface NpThemeFieldRequirement {
  type:
    | "text" | "textarea" | "richtext" | "number" | "boolean"
    | "date" | "select" | "media" | "relationship" | "blocks";
  /** for select */
  options?: string[];
  /** for relationship */
  to?: string;
  hasMany?: boolean;
  required?: boolean;
  /** Required (default: true). False = "nice to have, theme degrades gracefully" */
  hard?: boolean;
}
```

**Deferred to F.8**: actually applying these to user collections.
F.1 only ships the type + admin warning surface.

### 4.2 Phase F.2 — `impl.routes`: declarative dynamic routes

**Purpose**: themes register URL patterns the framework's catch-
all dispatches to. Closes the dynamic-archive gap (`/category/
[slug]`, `/tag/[slug]`, `/author/[id]`, `/:year/:month`, `/search`).

**Shape**:

```ts
impl: {
  routes?: NpThemeRoute[];
  /** Sugar layer over routes for common archive patterns. */
  archives?: NpThemeArchives;
}

interface NpThemeRoute {
  /** path-to-regexp pattern. Examples:
   *   "/category/:slug"
   *   "/tag/:slug"
   *   "/author/:id"
   *   "/:year(\\d{4})/:month(\\d{2})"
   *   "/search"
   *   "/lookbook"
   */
  pattern: string;
  component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>;
  /** Optional metadata builder for SEO. */
  metadata?: (ctx: NpRouteRenderProps) => Promise<Metadata>;
  /** Optional cache hint — defaults to dynamic. */
  revalidate?: number | false;
}

interface NpRouteRenderProps {
  params: Record<string, string>;
  searchParams: Record<string, string | string[] | undefined>;
  blockCtx: NpBlockRenderContext;
}

interface NpThemeArchives {
  [collectionSlug: string]: {
    byCategory?: { component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>; pattern?: string };
    byTag?: { component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>; pattern?: string };
    byAuthor?: { component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>; pattern?: string };
    byDate?: {
      component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>;
      granularity: "year" | "month" | "day";
      pattern?: string;
    };
    search?: { component: ComponentType<NpRouteRenderProps>; pattern?: string };
  };
}
```

**Dispatch precedence** (in `apps/web/(site)/[[...slug]]`):

1. App-explicit Next.js route file → Next routes natively, framework
   never sees the request.
2. **Page document slug lookup** → operator's authored pages always
   win when the URL matches an existing slug. This means an operator
   who creates a page with slug `lookbook` overrides the theme's
   `/lookbook` route. Operator-first is the right stance for the
   no-code promise — theme can't silently shadow a CMS page.
3. Theme `routes` (declared order, first match wins) → invoke
   component.
4. Theme `archives` sugar (expanded into routes by framework) →
   invoke component.
5. → 404.

App overrides at level 1 are an escape hatch for custom Next.js
work; level 2 ensures theme contributions never silently shadow
operator-authored content. Theme routes remain useful for
parameterized patterns (`/category/:slug`) which page slugs can't
match anyway, and for static slugs the operator chooses _not_ to
author as a page.

**Page-slug check is exact-match only.** A page with slug
`lookbook` does not match a theme route declared as
`/lookbook/:section`. Parameterized URLs always fall through to
the theme route layer, since page documents don't have parameter
semantics.

**`generateMetadata` shares the dispatcher.** The catch-all's
`generateMetadata` consults the same dispatcher: if a theme route
matches and declares `metadata`, that builder is invoked. Without
this sharing, `/category/foo` would render the theme component
but emit framework-fallback SEO — a real bug.

**Data fetching**: the route component fetches its own data via
`findDocuments` / typed wrappers. Operator tunability comes from
F.3 settings (e.g. `postsPerPage`). Framework provides
`getArchiveQuery({ collection, params, settings })` helper for
the boilerplate path but does not force its use.

**Locale**: framework resolves locale before dispatch; route
component receives it via `getCurrentLocale()` like other RSC.

**Block ctx**: framework constructs a fresh `NpBlockRenderContext`
per request and threads it to the route component, mirroring how
page templates already receive it.

### 4.3 Phase F.3 — `manifest.settingsSchema` + auto-form

**Purpose**: themes expose operator-tunable options without
forcing token-tree extension. Admin auto-renders a form from the
schema; operator never edits code.

**Shape**:

```ts
manifest: {
  settingsSchema?: ZodSchema;
}
```

Zod schema serves three roles:

1. Type inference for `getThemeSettings()` return type.
2. Admin auto-form generation (zod → form fields).
3. Runtime validation when reading from `np_settings`.

**Supported zod field types** (form generator initial coverage):

- `z.string()` → text input. Modifiers: `.url()` → URL input,
  `.regex(/#[0-9a-f]{6}/i)` → color picker (heuristic match).
- `z.number().int().min(N).max(M)` → number input with range.
- `z.boolean()` → toggle.
- `z.enum([...])` → select.
- `z.array(z.object({...}))` → repeating subform.
- `z.object({...})` → nested fieldset.

Each field accepts `.default(value)` and `.describe("Help text")`
which the form generator surfaces.

**Storage**: one `np_settings` row per theme per site. The
existing schema is `(siteId, key) → jsonb value` with a composite
primary key, so each theme's settings live at:

```
siteId = "<site>", key = "theme.settings:<themeId>",
value = z.infer<typeof settingsSchema>
```

Per-theme rows (rather than a single `key = "theme.settings"`
row holding a `Record<themeId, …>`) buy two things: writes on
one theme don't lock the whole settings blob, and theme switching
reads only the active theme's row, not every installed theme's
data. Cache invalidation reuses the existing `nx:theme:<siteId>`
tag (see §5.3) rather than introducing a per-theme tag — only
the active theme is read at request time, so per-theme tag
granularity wouldn't pay for itself.

**Coexistence with existing settings rows.** Three settings keys
participate in theme state, each with a distinct purpose:

| Key                        | Purpose                                                  | Phase |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `activeTheme`              | Active theme id for the site (existing)                  | v0.1  |
| `theme`                    | Token overrides — colors / typography / shape (existing) | v0.1  |
| `theme.settings:<themeId>` | New per-theme settings blob (this phase)                 | v0.2  |

The new key is namespaced with a colon to avoid collision with
the v0.1 `theme` row, and keyed by theme id so multiple installed
themes' settings coexist without clobbering each other.

On read, validated against the current `settingsSchema`. Validation
failure surfaces as an admin warning toast and falls back to
schema defaults.

**API**:

- Server: `await getThemeSettings()` → `z.infer<typeof schema>`.
  Memoized per request.
- Client: settings flow as props from server parents. Direct
  client hook intentionally omitted (settings rarely change per
  client interaction, and a hook would drag zod into the browser).

**Schema evolution**: v0.2 ships strict `parse()`. Schema change
on theme upgrade → admin shows mismatch banner with "reset to
defaults" action. Migration helpers (`migrate(old, fromVersion)`)
deferred to v0.3 unless field demand surfaces during F.9 rebuild.

**Auto-form infrastructure sharing**: the same form generator
serves plugin config UIs. F.3 builds the generator as a shared
admin primitive (`packages/admin/src/zod-form/`). Plugins that
currently hand-code their config UIs migrate as a followup.

### 4.4 Phase F.4 — `impl.blocks`: theme-shipped block types

**Purpose**: themes ship block types (e.g. `magazine.hero-feature`,
`magazine.three-col-grid`) that participate in the page builder
exactly like plugin blocks.

**Shape**:

```ts
impl: {
  blocks?: NpBlockDefinition[];  // same type plugins use
}
```

**Registration model — installed vs active.** The shared block
registry is process-global (single Node process serves multiple
sites). It MUST hold blocks from every _installed_ theme module,
not only the currently-active one for a given site, because:

- Multiple sites in the same process can each have a different
  active theme. Site A active = `magazine`, Site B active =
  `portfolio`. Both themes' blocks must be available in-process.
- Deactivating a theme on Site A by purging its blocks from the
  registry would also break rendering for Site B if it's using
  the same theme — and would break stale instances on Site A.

**The activation filter lives at admin/render time, not at
registry write time.** When admin lists "available block types
for the page builder" or `renderBlocks` resolves a `type` string,
the filter is "blocks contributed by themes/plugins active _for
the current site context_". Registry stays append-only; the active-
theme query is what gates visibility.

**Source identity contract — required for the filter to work.**
The activation filter compares each registry entry's `source`
against the site's currently-active theme id and enabled plugin
ids. For this to actually distinguish (e.g.) `magazine` blocks
from `portfolio` blocks when both themes are installed in the
same process, the `source` field MUST carry the concrete
contributor id, not a broad category label:

| Contributor | `source` value         | Example               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Theme       | `theme:<manifest.id>`  | `theme:magazine`      |
| Plugin      | `plugin:<manifest.id>` | `plugin:reading-time` |
| Built-in    | `core`                 | `core`                |

The framework's bootstrap auto-stamps `source` based on the
registration call path: `registerBlock` invoked from
`loadThemes` → stamps `theme:<themeId>`; from `loadPlugins` →
`plugin:<pluginId>`. Theme/plugin authors don't pass `source`
manually.

The activation filter compares concrete ids. Broad labels
(`"theme"` / `"plugin"`) can appear in admin UI groupings ("All
theme blocks") but never as filter keys — using a broad label as
a filter would lump every installed theme together and re-create
the multi-site collision the append-only registry is designed to
avoid.

**Migration impact.** The existing block registry's `source`
field (used by some plugin blocks today) accepts broader values.
F.4 tightens the contract: registrations through
`loadThemes`/`loadPlugins` go through the auto-stamping path;
direct `registerBlock` calls with a broad `source` continue to
work but won't filter correctly under multi-site. A dev-mode
console warning catches the latter.

**Stale instance handling**: when an operator deactivates a theme,
existing pages may have block instances of that theme's types.
v0.2 behavior:

- Renderer (`renderBlocks`) emits a `<NpUnknownBlock>` placeholder
  with the original `type` shown.
- Page builder shows the block as a red error card with the
  block's last-known `props` JSON visible and "Remove" / "Reactivate
  theme" actions.
- A "cleanup unknown blocks" admin action (bulk remove) is **noted
  but deferred to v0.3** — not blocking F.4.

**Namespacing**: theme blocks SHOULD use a namespace prefix
matching the theme manifest id (`magazine.foo` for theme `id:
"magazine"`). The framework does not enforce this in v0.2 but
admin lints against unprefixed types in dev mode. Two themes
shipping the same unprefixed type will see "last loaded wins"
silently — convention-driven, not contract-enforced.

### 4.5 Phase F.5 — `impl.patterns`: composable block presets

**Purpose**: theme ships pre-composed block trees the operator
drops into the page builder as starting points.

**Shape**:

```ts
impl: {
  patterns?: NpBlockPattern[];
}

interface NpBlockPattern {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  /** Optional preview image path, served from theme's public/ */
  preview?: string;
  /** Group in admin pattern picker. */
  category?: "homepage" | "page" | "section" | string;
  /** The block tree expanded on insert. */
  blocks: NpBlockInstance[];
  /** Optional one-line description. */
  description?: string;
}
```

**Builder integration**: page builder gains an "Insert pattern"
side panel grouped by category, with preview thumbnails. On
click, the pattern's `blocks` are deep-cloned with fresh ids and
inserted at the cursor; afterwards, those blocks are regular
editable instances. The pattern itself is read-only metadata.

**Plugin patterns**: plugins gain the same field on
`NpPluginDefinition.patterns`. Theme + plugin patterns merge into
the same registry (namespaced by source id).

### 4.6 Phase F.6 — `impl.navLocations`: nav mount points

**Purpose**: theme declares semantic locations for nav menus;
operator assigns existing menus to locations in admin.

**Shape**:

```ts
impl: {
  navLocations?: Record<string, NpNavLocation>;
}

interface NpNavLocation {
  label: string;
  description?: string;
  maxItems?: number;
}
```

**Theme component usage**:

```tsx
import { NavMenu } from "@nexpress/next/client";
<NavMenu location="primary" />;
```

**Admin integration**: extends the nav editor (#429) to include
a "Location assignments" panel where each declared location
shows a dropdown of existing menus (or "— none —"). Persisted
in `np_settings.navAssignments[themeId][locationKey] = menuId`.

### 4.7 Phase F.7 — error / 404 / SEO surfaces

**Purpose**: themes own user-visible chrome on error pages,
sitemap structure, and feed branding.

**Shape**:

```ts
impl: {
  notFound?: ComponentType;
  error?: ComponentType<{ error: Error & { digest?: string }; reset: () => void }>;
  seo?: {
    sitemapEntries?: () => Promise<NpSitemapEntry[]>;
    feedEntries?: () => Promise<NpFeedEntry[]>;
    robotsTxt?: () => string | Promise<string>;
  };
}
```

`apps/web/(site)/not-found.tsx` and `error.tsx` (Next conventions)
delegate to the active theme's component when defined; otherwise
render the framework default. Sitemap/feed/robots helpers compose
with `@nexpress/core/seo`'s existing entry builders (the public
types are `NpSitemapEntry` and `NpFeedEntry` — no rename in v0.2).

**Cache invalidation.** Sitemap and feed are site-scoped cached
under the **existing `nx:*` cache-tag namespace** (the `np`
prefix migration intentionally left Next.js cache tags as
`nx:*` — they're internal cache infrastructure, not part of the
public API surface). The actual tags written by `revalidate.ts`
today are:

- `nx:sitemap:<siteId>` (per-site sitemap)
- `nx:sitemap` (global sitemap index)
- `nx:feed:<siteId>` (per-site feed root)
- `nx:feed:<siteId>:<collection>` (per-collection feed)

When a theme contributes SEO hooks (`seo.sitemapEntries` /
`seo.feedEntries`), the following settings-row writes MUST also
invalidate the relevant `nx:sitemap:*` / `nx:feed:*` tags:

| Settings event      | Row written                        | Invalidates                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active-theme switch | `key = "activeTheme"`              | `nx:sitemap:<siteId>`, `nx:feed:<siteId>`                                                               |
| Theme settings save | `key = "theme.settings:<themeId>"` | same — only if the theme declares `seo.*` hooks; pure-style settings (e.g. `accentColor`) skip the bust |
| Theme tokens save   | `key = "theme"`                    | no — tokens don't affect sitemap/feed content                                                           |

The framework wires these invalidations in the settings save path
based on the active theme's implementation (`impl.seo` declared
→ SEO tags participate). Themes don't have to think about it,
but they do have to declare their SEO hooks on `impl.seo` so the
framework knows whether to bust SEO cache on settings save.

### 4.8 Phase F.8 — `pnpm exec nexpress theme add`

**Purpose**: the CLI step that closes the operator-no-code loop.
Installs a theme package, registers it in `nexpress.config.ts` via
theme marker comments, validates that the package exports the expected
named theme object, and leaves schema materialization to
`pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate` unless the operator passes
`--apply`.

**UX flow**:

```
$ pnpm exec nexpress theme add @nexpress/theme-magazine
✓ Loaded @nexpress/theme-magazine 0.1.0

  Required collections:
    posts (existing) — adding fields:
      + featured: boolean (default false)
      + coverImage: relationship → media (required)
    categories (existing) — no changes
    authors (NEW) — creating with 3 fields

  Continue? [y/N] y

✓ Installed @nexpress/theme-magazine
✓ Updated src/nexpress.config.ts theme markers

  Next:
    1. Run `pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate`
       (`theme add --apply` can chain this)
    2. Run `pnpm --silent run ops:preflight -- --target <host> --json`
    3. Activate "@nexpress/theme-magazine" in admin → Settings → Theme
```

**Implementation tooling**:

- Config edit: marker-aware import + `themes:` array patch in
  `nexpress.config.ts`.
- Requirement merge: `defineConfig` auto-merges theme
  `manifest.requires.collections` into the resolved collection shape;
  operator collection files stay untouched.
- Migration: `theme add --apply` chains `db:generate` + `db:migrate`;
  otherwise the CLI prints that follow-up explicitly.
- Conflict detection: if an operator-authored field name already
  exists with a _different type_, admin requirement checks explain
  the conflict and point at the relevant collection file.
- Dry-run: `--dry-run` prints planned dependency/config changes,
  writes nothing.

**Safety invariants**:

- Never overwrites an operator collection file — theme requirements
  are merged at config-resolution time.
- Type mismatch on an existing operator field = visible requirement
  conflict instead of silent schema mutation.
- No DB writes happen in plain `theme add`. The migration must be
  applied manually with `pnpm db:migrate`, or explicitly chained with
  `theme add --apply`.

**Out of scope for F.8**:

- Theme removal (later shipped as `theme remove`) → v0.3.
- Cross-theme migration (`theme add` switching from theme A
  to theme B) → operator runs install on B; A's extra fields
  remain (idempotent, harmless).

### 4.9 Phase F.9 — Reference theme rebuild

**Purpose**: prove the contract by rebuilding three v0.2 reference
themes against the full v0.2 surface. Each press a different
axis.

| Theme                       | Stresses                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `@nexpress/theme-magazine`  | F.2 archives (category/tag/author/date), F.3 settings (hero variant, accent color), F.4 blocks (hero-feature, three-col-grid), F.5 patterns (homepage compositions), F.6 nav (primary + footer). |

`packages/themes/minimal` retired. `packages/themes/default` remains
the scaffold fallback and v0.1 baseline reference.

**Validation gate**: each theme + a recorded demo where an operator
goes `pnpm create nexpress my-site → pnpm exec nexpress theme add
<theme> → pnpm db:migrate → admin only → live customized site`.
The two CLI steps match §0; everything after `db:migrate` happens
in admin without touching code. If any of the three themes can't
complete that loop, the contract is incomplete and we file a
follow-up phase before declaring v0.2 done.

## 5. Architectural decisions

Resolved before implementation; deviations need a doc update.

### 5.1 Archive route data fetching

**Decision**: route component fetches its own data via
`findDocuments` / generated typed wrappers. Framework provides
`getArchiveQuery({ collection, params, settings })` as a
_helper_ (not a wrapper), but does not pre-fetch.

**Why not pre-fetch**: pre-fetching forces a "what does the
theme want?" guess in the framework. Magazine theme wants
"published, in category X, sorted by `featuredOrder` ASC then
`publishedAt` DESC". Docs theme wants "by hierarchy". A pre-fetcher
that handles both balloons. Direct fetch is simpler and matches
how page templates already work.

**Tradeoff**: theme authors rewrite a small fetch boilerplate
per route. The helper covers the 80% case.

### 5.2 Catch-all dispatch cost

**Decision**: linear scan of declared routes per request, ordered
by declaration. `path-to-regexp` per pattern.

For typical themes (~10 routes), per-request matching cost is
sub-millisecond. If a theme declares 100+ routes (unlikely), we
revisit with a trie or build-time codegen of a Next.js route file
per pattern. **Defer optimization until measured pain.**

### 5.3 Theme settings caching

**Decision**: settings fetched once per request from `np_settings`,
parsed by zod, memoized for the request lifetime. Settings save
in admin reuses the existing `nx:theme:<siteId>` cache tag (which
already covers tokens + active theme id from v0.1) — theme
settings are read on the same code paths that read tokens, so a
shared bust is correct and avoids fragmenting the tag namespace.
SEO tags (`nx:sitemap:*` / `nx:feed:*`) additionally participate
only when the active theme declares `impl.seo.*` hooks (see §4.7).

zod parse cost is ~tens of microseconds for typical schemas —
not the bottleneck. Per-request memoization is enough.

### 5.4 Stale block / pattern instances after deactivation

**Decision**: render placeholder + admin red card; bulk cleanup
deferred to v0.3.

Operators uncomfortable with placeholders can manually delete
unknown blocks per page. The bulk-cleanup tool is a UX
convenience, not a correctness fix.

### 5.5 settingsSchema evolution

**Decision**: v0.2 = strict parse, mismatch → defaults + admin
warning. Migration helpers added in v0.3 if F.9 rebuild surfaces
real friction.

### 5.6 Multi-site / multi-tenant

**Decision**: theme settings keyed by `siteId` via existing
`np_settings.siteId` scoping. Theme code itself stays
process-global (different sites can share the same theme module).

### 5.7 CLI config-patch safety

**Decision**: `theme add` only edits dependency state and
`nexpress.config.ts` marker ranges. It never rewrites operator
collection files. Conflicting operator fields surface through
theme requirement checks, and dry-run mode is required for plan
review without mutation.

### 5.8 Plugin / theme name collisions

**Decision**: type-name prefixing is convention; **`source`
identity is contract** (see §4.4 for the registry-side rule).

- Block `type` strings: theme blocks SHOULD prefix with theme id,
  plugin blocks SHOULD prefix with plugin id (admin lint warns
  in dev). This is convention because two themes shipping the
  same unprefixed type still resolve via `source` at filter time.
- Block `source` field: framework auto-stamps `theme:<id>` /
  `plugin:<id>` based on registration call path. Activation
  filter compares against these concrete ids, not broad labels.
  This is contract — required for multi-site correctness.
- Routes: theme routes evaluated before plugin routes; both
  evaluated after app-explicit and after page-slug lookup
  (precedence locked in §4.2). First match wins, with dev-mode
  warning if a pattern is shadowed by an earlier layer.
- Patterns: registered with `source: "theme:<id>"` /
  `source: "plugin:<id>"` (same auto-stamping). Same pattern
  `id` from two sources = silent overwrite (last-loaded wins)
  with dev warning. Pattern `source` doubles as admin UI grouping.

## 6. Phase ordering

```
F.1 (requires declaration)        ← design-only, unblocks F.8
  ↓
F.2 (routes + archives sugar)     ← largest unlock; ~2 PRs
  ↓
F.3 (settingsSchema + auto-form)  ← noco core; auto-form is shared infra ~2 PRs
  ↓
F.4 (theme blocks)                ← small; F.5 prereq
  ↓
F.5 (patterns + builder UI)       ← UI heavy ~2 PRs
  ↓
F.6 (navLocations)                ← small, builds on #429
  ↓
F.7 (error/404/seo)               ← small
  ↓
F.8 (CLI theme add)               ← config registration + drizzle integration ~2 PRs, highest risk
  ↓
F.9 (reference theme rebuild)     ← integration test, 3 themes ~3 PRs
```

PR estimate: **~15 PRs over 1–2 months.** Each PR keeps `pnpm
build / typecheck / test` green; tests for new fields land with
the field.

## 7. Validation

The v0.2 contract is "done" when:

1. All eight `NpThemeImpl` / `NpThemeManifest` field additions
   ship with tests.
2. Three reference themes (magazine, docs, portfolio) build
   against the new contract with no per-theme app-level patches.
3. The recorded operator-no-code demo (per F.9) succeeds for all
   three themes.
4. v0.1 themes (the four current ones, until retired) still load
   without modification — fields are all optional.

Failure of any of (1)–(3) blocks the v0.2 release; remediation
either extends the contract (file a new phase) or revises an
existing phase before declaring done.

## 9. Backwards compatibility

- All v0.2 additions are optional. v0.1 themes continue to load.
- `defineTheme()` signature unchanged — still identity-pass-through.
- `NpThemeManifest` / `NpThemeImpl` extended with optional fields;
  existing fields untouched.
- Block / route / pattern registries are new — no existing
  consumer to break.
- The four v0.1 reference themes remain in-tree until F.9 retires
  them (replaced by 3 v0.2 themes).

## 10. Deferred to v0.3 (recorded, not abandoned)

Per the agreement to track everything we postpone:

- **Default-on migration apply** — `theme add --apply` can chain
  `db:generate` + `db:migrate`, but the default command still keeps
  the DB-write boundary explicit so operators can review the generated
  migration SQL before it hits the database. Making apply default-on
  remains a separate operator-safety decision.
- **Theme removal CLI** — shipped after F.8 as
  `pnpm exec nexpress theme remove <pkg>` with destructive confirmation
  and config cleanup before migration generation.
- **Bulk "cleanup unknown blocks" admin action** — placeholder
  rendering covers correctness; bulk action is convenience.
- **`settingsSchema` migration helpers** — v0.2 falls back to
  defaults on mismatch. Real migration helpers tracked here.
- **Cross-theme migration** — switching themes A → B is
  idempotent at install time but doesn't remove A's leftover
  fields. Cleanup workflow tracked here.
- **Member/community surface skinning** — `(site)/members/*`,
  member dashboards, community surface components remain
  app-owned in v0.2. Separate track post-v0.2.
- **Plugin config auto-form migration** — F.3 builds the
  zod-to-form generator for theme settings; plugins keep their
  hand-coded config UIs until a follow-up migrates them.

## 11. Open questions for implementation phase

These don't block the design lock, but need answers as code lands:

1. Does `getArchiveQuery` helper live in `@nexpress/core/seo`,
   `@nexpress/next`, or a new `@nexpress/core/archives`? Decide
   when F.2 lands.
2. Does the auto-form generator support `z.discriminatedUnion`
   in v0.2 or wait for v0.3? Decide when F.3 starts.
3. Pattern preview images — bundled in theme `public/` or a
   separate metadata API? Decide when F.5 starts.
4. CLI conflict resolution UI — abort-only (current plan) or
   interactive resolve? Decide when F.8 starts.
