# Shop plugin and Storefront theme

`@nexpress/plugin-shop` is the first-party catalog foundation for NexPress.
It owns product and category data, inventory projection, public catalog
routes, Admin collection forms, dashboard metrics, blocks, and skins.

`@nexpress/theme-storefront` is a separate brand/content theme. It works with
ordinary pages and posts when Shop is absent. When both packages are active,
the theme enhances Shop through documented CSS variables, classes, data
attributes, and optional page blocks; neither package imports the other.

This release is deliberately **catalog-only**. It does not create carts,
checkout sessions, payments, orders, fulfillment, refunds, or claim that a
visitor completed a purchase.

## Default setup

Fresh NexPress projects receive `shopCollections`, `shopPlugin`, and
`storefrontTheme` through the framework defaults. After applying the generated
migration:

1. Open Admin → Commerce → Shop categories and publish categories.
2. Open Admin → Commerce → Products and publish products.
3. Visit `/shop`.
4. Optionally activate Storefront from Admin → Appearance.
5. Add the `shop.category-grid` and `shop.featured-products` blocks to a page,
   or insert the `shop.storefront-home` pattern.

Sites upgrading from a version without Shop must generate, review, and apply
the collection migration:

```bash
pnpm schema:gen
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

## Product contract

Prices are safe integers in the currency's minor unit:

- KRW and JPY use whole currency units.
- USD and EUR use cents.
- Values range from `0` through `2,147,483,647`, matching the generated
  PostgreSQL `integer` column exactly.
- `compareAtPriceMinor`, when present, must be greater than `priceMinor`.

The product SKU is optional, normalized to uppercase, and unique within one
site. Variant SKUs are required, uppercase, unique within the product, and
must differ from the product SKU. Product names accept up to 180 characters,
variant names up to 120, SKUs up to 64, galleries up to 12 images, and
products up to 100 variants.

Inventory has one exact projection:

- With no enabled variants, `stockQuantity` is the product stock.
- With enabled variants, aggregate stock is the sum of enabled variant stock;
  the standalone product quantity is not double-counted.
- When tracking is off, state is `untracked` and the product remains
  available.
- Tracked zero stock becomes `out-of-stock`.
- Tracked positive stock at or below `lowStockThreshold` becomes `low-stock`.
- Higher tracked stock becomes `in-stock`.

The write hook derives hidden `available` and `inventoryState` fields before
persistence. Public queries use those stored fields for bounded filtering,
while the runtime recomputes and validates the projection before rendering so
malformed persisted commercial values fail closed.

Categories cannot be deleted while any product still references them. Move or
remove the relationship first.

## Public routes and discovery

| Route                            | Purpose                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/shop`                          | Published product catalog             |
| `/shop/categories/:categorySlug` | One published category                |
| `/shop/products/:productSlug`    | Product detail, variants, and gallery |

Catalog and category routes recognize:

| Query   | Contract                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q`     | Whitespace-normalized full-text query, at most 120 characters |
| `sort`  | `newest`, `price-asc`, `price-desc`, or `name`                |
| `stock` | The literal `available`                                       |
| `page`  | Canonical positive integer from 1 through 10,000              |

Duplicated or malformed recognized parameters fail closed. Unknown campaign
parameters are ignored. Filter state survives pagination. Collection SEO paths
feed the shared sitemap/search contracts, and product metadata includes its
summary and primary image.

## Admin surfaces

The two collections appear in the Commerce group. Product editing includes
price, tax-display, media, SKU, inventory, variants, featured state, and skin
selection. Operator-only derived fields stay hidden.

The plugin also declares two typed dashboard metric actions:

- total product rows;
- published low-stock products.

The manifest-level action registry binds each metric widget to its exact
handler kind, so plugin validation and doctor can inspect the relationship
before a click.

## Skins and theme integration

Every Shop factory registers:

| ID                | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `classic`         | Compact, neutral catalog and detail fallback               |
| `storefront-full` | Larger editorial header and image-led product presentation |

Both skins implement catalog, category, and product rendering. They receive
prepared products, localized messages, safe formatted money, and rendered
rich text; they do not own collection policy.

Plugin structure ships in `@layer np-blocks` and consumes stable properties
with core-token fallbacks:

```css
--np-shop-content-max
--np-shop-gutter
--np-shop-surface
--np-shop-soft
--np-shop-ink
--np-shop-subtle
--np-shop-line
--np-shop-accent
--np-shop-accent-foreground
```

The main public hooks are `.np-shop`, `.np-shop-product-card`,
`.np-shop-product-grid`, `.np-shop-category-grid`, `.np-shop-filters`,
`[data-np-shop-surface]`, `[data-np-shop-skin]`,
`[data-np-shop-inventory]`, and `[data-np-shop-block]`.

Storefront sets those variables on its shell and adds optional selectors, but
declares no Shop collection requirement. Shop uses core theme-token fallbacks
and remains complete under Default, Community, Magazine, Portfolio, Docs, or
a third-party theme.

## Customized registration

Use one factory result for both collections and plugin:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nexpress/core";
import { createShop } from "@nexpress/plugin-shop";

const shop = createShop({
  basePath: "/catalog",
  collections: {
    categories: "catalog-categories",
    products: "catalog-products",
  },
  defaultSkinId: "storefront-full",
});

export default defineConfig({
  collections: [...shop.collections],
  plugins: [shop.plugin],
});
```

Collection slugs and the route root are code/schema decisions. Change them
before the first migration. Do not call `createShop()` separately for the
collection and plugin arrays: handlers, relationships, routes, blocks, and
Admin actions intentionally close over one runtime definition.

Custom build-time skins implement `NpShopSkin` and may be added through the
factory's `skins` option. Existing `classic` and `storefront-full` ids cannot
be replaced.

## Next commerce slices

Future transaction work should remain separable from this foundation:

1. cart and checkout intent;
2. payment-provider adapters and idempotent webhook intake;
3. order, refund, fulfillment, and customer Admin workflows;
4. stock reservation and transactional decrement;
5. legal/tax/shipping policy integrations.

Those features require explicit payment, security, and operational contracts.
The current catalog data and independent theme do not pre-authorize or emulate
them.
