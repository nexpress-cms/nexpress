"@nexpress/app": patch
---

Extend the `fixed` versioning group in `.changeset/config.json` to cover every publishable `@nexpress/*` package (29 packages: core, admin, app, auth-pages, blocks, cli, editor, next, oauth-providers, rate-limiter-redis, theme, theme-default/docs/magazine/portfolio, plugin-sdk, all `plugin-*` and `plugin-block-*`, wp-import, xliff). Previously only seven were grouped, which meant new packages joining the family (`@nexpress/app@0.1.1` was the first to surface this) could land on npm at a version that didn't match the scaffold's pinned range (`^0.1.3` against an app at `0.1.1`).

With fixed-versioning across the full set, every member of the family bumps in lockstep on every release — the SCAFFOLDED_NEXPRESS_RANGE assumption ("everything on the same `0.1.x`") becomes self-enforcing, and new packages joining the group automatically start at the family's current version instead of falling behind.

Adds a release-wide noise floor (variant-less packages produce empty CHANGELOG entries on bump). The tradeoff is intentional: alignment > minimal version churn at 0.x.
