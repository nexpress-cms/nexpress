Fix the "Setup already completed" 409 loop on the first-boot Admin Setup wizard. The route's chain — admin `INSERT` → `updateSite` → `seedAll` → token sign — was not wrapped in a transaction. If `updateSite` or `seedAll` threw (e.g. validation or seed-time error), the admin row was already committed and every retry hit `adminCount > 0` and returned 409 with the umbrella "Setup already completed" message. Server log showed the diagnostic shape: `POST /api/admin/setup 400 (309ms)` → `POST /api/admin/setup 409 (11ms)` — the 400 came from a post-INSERT throw, the 409s from the partial commit.

Two changes:

- **Best-effort `updateSite` + `seedAll`** in `route.ts`. Both are now individually try/caught; the admin row stays committed (so the wizard finishes) and the failures surface as `warnings[]` on the success response. Operator can fix data afterwards from Admin → Settings / Collections.

- **`NpValidationError.fields[]` surfaced in `setup-client.tsx`**. The client previously showed only the umbrella `error.message` ("Invalid input") even though the response carries the actual offending fields. Reads like `Invalid input (password: Password must be at least 12 characters)` now instead of a screen that says nothing.
