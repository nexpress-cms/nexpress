Two more first-boot regressions surfaced when verifying the admin setup wizard end-to-end on a fresh scaffold:

1. **`Site "default" not found` 400 on admin setup.** `np_sites` is created by migrations but the default row isn't seeded — `ensureDefaultSite()` exists in `@nexpress/core` but nothing in bootstrap actually calls it. The wizard's `updateSite(NP_DEFAULT_SITE_ID, …)` therefore threw on first call. Added an explicit `await ensureDefaultSite()` inside the setup route before the admin INSERT. (Wiring it into `ensureFor` more broadly is the cleaner long-term fix and stays in the queue.)

2. **Built-in theme packs missing from scaffolds.** Scaffold `package.json` only carried `@nexpress/theme` (the engine), not `@nexpress/theme-default / -docs / -magazine / -portfolio`. Result: admin's Appearance → Themes was empty, and there were no theme assets to register at boot. Added all four as direct deps in `getProjectFiles`. They join the fixed-versioning group automatically (since they're `@nexpress/*` and on npm at 0.1.5).
