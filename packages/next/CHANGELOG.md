# @nexpress/next

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- de22826: Publish-readiness sweep — package metadata, license, and publishability.

  Every `@nexpress/*` library and `create-nexpress` becomes publishable
  to npm: `"private": true` removed, full metadata added (description,
  license, repository with `directory`, author, bugs, homepage, keywords,
  engines.node), and a `prepublishOnly: "pnpm build"` safety net so a
  one-off `pnpm publish` from inside a package directory still rebuilds
  before tarball.

  A repo-root `LICENSE` (MIT) is added and copied into every published
  package's directory so each tarball ships its own license file (npm
  auto-includes LICENSE at the package root, but only if the file
  actually lives there — repo-root licenses don't propagate).

  `apps/web` (the reference app) stays `"private": true` — it's not a
  distributable package.

  No code change; this is publish-bookkeeping only. Versions move from
  `0.0.0` (or `0.1.0` for the existing plugin packages) to a coherent
  `0.1.0` floor when `pnpm changeset version` runs against all currently
  queued changesets.

### Patch Changes

- 952483c: Phase 22.2 — surface known-unsafe configurations at boot via the
  structured logger.

  `@nexpress/core` adds `verifyStartupSafety(input)` (re-exported from
  the package root) — a pure function that takes the resolved storage
  adapter id, the auth secret, `NODE_ENV`, and the `NP_MULTI_NODE` flag,
  and emits warnings through `getScopedLogger({ subsystem: "boot" })`
  for the two operationally-bitten cases:
  - `LocalStorageAdapter` running with `NP_MULTI_NODE=true` (or `=1`),
    which silently drops uploads as nodes diverge on the local
    `./uploads` dir.
  - `NODE_ENV=production` with `NP_SECRET` unset or shorter than 32
    characters, which lets sessions be forged with a weak key.

  `@nexpress/next` calls the helper once per process from
  `createBootstrap()`'s `ensureServices`, so any app using the standard
  bootstrap (apps/web, scaffolded sites) picks the warnings up
  automatically. Operators with `setLogger(...)` already in place get
  the warnings in their structured-log pipeline; others see them on
  stdout via the default `consoleLogger`.

  Returns the list of emitted warning ids so tests can assert on them;
  nothing in production reads the return value.
