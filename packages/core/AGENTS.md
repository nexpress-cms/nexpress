## SINGLETONS (wiring order matters)

| Singleton                              | Defined in            | Set by app via                        |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `setDb(db)` / `getDb()`                | `db/runtime.ts`       | `createBootstrap` in `@nexpress/next` |
| `setStorageAdapter(adapter)`           | `storage/registry.ts` | Bootstrap validates `config.storage`  |
| logger / error reporter                | `observability/`      | Bootstrap validates env + adapters    |
| `setJobQueue(queue)` / `getJobQueue()` | `jobs/queue.ts`       | Bootstrap producer or worker          |
| `pluginRegistry` / `globalHooks`       | `plugins/host.ts`     | `loadPlugins()` at startup            |

**Init order**: configureObservability → createDbConnection/setDb → setStorageAdapter → registerCollections → loadPlugins → email/producer or worker. Shutdown reverses dependencies and closes observability last. Wrong order = runtime "not initialized" errors or missed boot diagnostics.

Raw setters, registry mutation, and plugin dispatch live under the host-only
`@nexpress/core/bootstrap` subpath and are absent from the root barrel. Normal
application code uses `createBootstrap().ensureFor(...)` and domain subpaths.

Rate limiting is initialized independently by the Next proxy entrypoint. Keep
its contract pure under `@nexpress/core/rate-limit`; custom multi-node adapters
must be injected from `src/proxy.ts`, not assumed to share app bootstrap state.

Storage uses the same separation under `@nexpress/core/storage`. That domain
subpath exposes contracts, factories, reads, and object operations without
singleton mutation. Built-in and custom intent are installed through the
host-only `configureStorageRuntime(config, adapter?)`. Framework call sites
use the `np*StorageObject` operations so safe keys, metadata, and results are
checked even for custom adapters. Do not bypass them with direct adapter calls.

Observability uses `@nexpress/core/observability`. Environment intent and both
adapters are installed transactionally before startup warnings. Framework code
must log/report through the safe facade, never call a raw adapter; dispatch and
async failures are deliberately contained and recorded for Admin Health.

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task                        | File(s)                                                       | Notes                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Change content write path   | `collections/pipeline.ts`                                     | ACL → validate → hooks → persist → revisions → media refs → search |
| Add/change system DB tables | `db/schema/system.ts`, `db/schema/media.ts`                   | npUsers, npMedia, npRevisions, npSettings, npNavigation            |
| Modify collection codegen   | `db/generator.ts` (496 lines)                                 | Produces Drizzle table definitions from NpCollectionConfig         |
| Modify TS type codegen      | `db/type-generator.ts`                                        | Produces TypeScript interfaces from configs                        |
| Change JWT/password logic   | `auth/token.ts`, `auth/password.ts`                           | jose for JWT, @node-rs/argon2 for passwords                        |
| Add session features        | `auth/session.ts`                                             | `verifyTokenFull`, `invalidateAllSessions`, tokenVersion checks    |
| Change media processing     | `media/processor.ts`                                          | sharp-based, `DEFAULT_IMAGE_SIZES` for variants                    |
| Change storage contracts    | `storage/contract.ts`, `storage/operations.ts`                | Keep bootstrap, media, doctor, health, and ops on one boundary     |
| Change observability        | `observability/contract.ts`, `logger.ts`, `error-reporter.ts` | Preserve failure isolation and direct-console fallback             |

| Add plugin capabilities     | `plugins/host.ts` + `plugin-sdk/src/types.ts`                 | Hook capability = `hooks:<namespace>` prefix matching              |
| Add error type              | `errors.ts`                                                   | Extend `NpError` with code + statusCode                            |

## INTERNAL DEPENDENCY FLOW

```
config/types ──→ used by ALL modules (canonical types)
db/schema    ──→ used by collections, media, auth, content
collections  ──→ imports jobs/queue (enqueueJob), plugins/host (runHook)
media        ──→ imports storage, jobs/queue, db/schema
content      ──→ imports collections (getDb, findDocuments), theme
plugins/host ──→ dynamic import of jobs/queue (avoids static cycle)
jobs/builtin ──→ uses configureBuiltinJobContext indirection (avoids importing collections)
jobs/handlers ──→ sites/context (optional payload-derived async-local dispatch scope)
```

No static import cycles exist. Cycle avoidance is via: dynamic imports in `plugins/host`, `configureBuiltinJobContext` indirection in `jobs/builtin-handlers`, and per-subsystem singletons.

## CONVENTIONS

- Public build entries are declared in `tsup.config.ts`; client-safe contracts such as `jobs-contract` must not import server dependencies. Apps reference the `db-schema` entry in `drizzle.config.ts`.
- `pipeline.ts` is the single largest file (1043 lines). Changes here affect every document write. Read the full flow before modifying.
- Content helpers in `content/helpers.ts` are thin wrappers over `getDb()` + direct SQL queries — they bypass the pipeline (no hooks/validation). Use `saveDocument`/`findDocuments` from collections for pipeline-protected writes.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Never import index.ts from internal modules** — barrel is for external consumers only. Internal imports use relative paths (`../jobs/queue.js`).
- **Never add static imports between jobs and collections/plugins** — use the existing indirection patterns (dynamic import, builtinJobContext).
- **Never rely on ambient request state in a durable job** — persist `siteId`, validate it in the payload parser, and register `resolveSiteId`; async-local state cannot cross a queue/process boundary.
- **Never call getDb()/getMediaDb()/getStorageAdapter() before the app has called the corresponding setter** — will throw at runtime.
